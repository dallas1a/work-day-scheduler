In this application the user is presented with the current date and is then given a row for each hour of the work day where they can add or remove the content for each hour. When the user chooses to save the info for that hour they can do so by clicking the save button, the program will then save the info for that event in local storage and will pull it up each time the program is opened until a new input is saved. Each hours timeblock is color coded to determine if the hour is in the the past , present , or future and will do so corresponding to the current hour.
